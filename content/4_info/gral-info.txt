Moreinfo: <p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Between 2016 and 2017, we were part of a cultural association programming a a former tram stop. From this project, with its characteristic format, we wanted to evolve by offering artists at the start of their careers a space for expression and representation that was nonetheless different from that of the classic exhibition. With Exhibitions on paper, we want to give visibility and disseminate the work of artists with whom we work on a longer-term basis. By separating ourselves from the physical space and temporal limitations of the exhibition, we concentrate on the production and dissemination of the objects produced. </p><p><strong>Statement</strong></p><p>For each project, we favor an individual approach in dialogue with the artist. We decide together on the publishing format, the printing technique, the choice of paper, the interventions, the signature, and so on. We want to offer artists a wider range of possibilities for conceptual interventions, and decisions will be more closely aligned with their project. </p>
