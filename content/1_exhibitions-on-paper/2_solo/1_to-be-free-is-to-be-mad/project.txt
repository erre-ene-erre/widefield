Eventinfo: <h2><a href="/@/page/3rJUMnL81udP865k">Manuela Libertad Morales Delano</a></h2><h3>To be Free is to be Mad</h3><p>Using common objects that she recreates or reframes on a variation, Delano conveys narratives that are both critical and poetic. Often with humor and a touch of cynicism, the artist seems to invite us to reconsider the situations she presents, unequivocally revealing the power of symbols and their influence. </p>

Moreinfo: <p><em>I remember we could only watch a VHS with Cartoon Network episodes looped and watch the movies my parents rented from time to time. </em></p><p><em>At that time (until I was 15 years old) we lived at the foot of a mountain. No internet, wild dogs, a neighbor, and a chocolater√≠a that never accepted our little change. The films I remember watching were "The Piano Teacher" and another of which I don't remember the title, about a boy who had visibility problems. One day, the boy is with his newborn brother and his mom left a knitting stick next to the crib. Then Baam! The movie takes a turn, it's a new day and now the boy can see and everyone else in the movie is blind. </em></p><p><em>With my sister, we were always afraid to run in the night to my parents' cabin, which was one minute running from where I and my sisters slept. Their little house was surrounded by cacti, which my grandmother said was unlucky as having cactus in front of the house meant you would never find a husband. One night my sister and I ran in fear to my parents' house and she fell into the cacti. I tried to remove the thorns but each time I touched them they went deeper. I see thorns as time-travelers of bonding like a coat passed down from generation to generation eaten by moths in the closet, which you cannot let go.</em> </p><p>Manuela Libertad Morales Delano </p>
