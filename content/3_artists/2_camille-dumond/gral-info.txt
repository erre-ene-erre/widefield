Info: <p>Camille Dumondâ€™s interdisciplinary practice takes the form of film productions, installations and editorial projects. Her films are hybrids of fiction and documentary, developed through an act of transposition: a real experience becomes a narrative, a chosen object provokes an artificial interaction, a biographical writing incorporates a supernatural story. Her sculptures and films are fused into installations, although the films can be shown independently in an exhibition or cinema. The challenge of her installation lies in the interaction with the bodies that visit it, and in the way in which the reference to the films propagates into the design and composition itself.</p><p>Her editorial project Entretiens pour un film is a series of publications that focuses on a filmmaker and the place they/he/she has chosen to escape from a particular world. The second issue, Gervasia Brocson, focuses on the work of Adriana Monti and was released in 2022.</p><p><a href="https://camilledumond.com/" target="_blank">Website</a></p>
