Info: <p>The practice of Manuela Morales Delano (born in Talcahuano, lives in Basel) spans various media often resulting in site-specific installations that address the economic and social impact of postcolonial legacies. Her works often include abstracted accounts of wealth accumulation, dominance and devotion. This allows her to connect with specific contexts and geographies, that she reconstructs and fictionalizes in order to create tensions between imposed narratives, vernacular legends and history.</p><p>In 2016 Manuela Morales Delano founded Mario Kreuzberg, an interdisciplinary project space located in Berlin. In 2022 the project was relocated to Basel and now she runs it together with Charles Benjamin at Salts. Recently, she has exhibited her work at Gallery Kendra Jayne Patrick/Bern, Kunsthaus Baselland, Basel / Muttenz; Milieu, Bern, and Oreilles Internaxionales, Basel. Manuela Morales Delano graduated with an MA from the Institute Art Gender Nature HGK Basel FHWN in 2022.</p>
