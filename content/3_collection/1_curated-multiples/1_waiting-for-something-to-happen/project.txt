Eventinfo: <p>‘Quarry’ refers to the double career (in french pun) produced by an interdisciplinary practice of making films and installing exhibitions. ‘Quarry’ also refers to the clay quarry, where the minerals were found to produce the glaze for the sculptures. Most of the glazes were made from tree ashes. Parallel Quarry reflects on the principle of symmetry and parallelism, between the symbolism of the sphere and the loop. Presentation to be written by us.</p>
